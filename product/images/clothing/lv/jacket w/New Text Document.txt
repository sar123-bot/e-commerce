This jacket makes a fresh signature statement in cotton gabardine featuring a graphic Monogram print in a blurry fil coupé-look finish. The boxy button-up silhouette is cut with a clean neckline and two sharp welt pockets for a crisp, modern look. A leather travel tag detail on the chest playfully nods to the House’s heritage.
