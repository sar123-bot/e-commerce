This short-sleeved knit shirt revisits the iconic Damier in a vibrantly-colored jacquard with a richly detailed effect. Pearl-effect buttons distinguish the closure, while a ‘Marque L.Vuitton déposée’ signature embellishes the chest pocket. Crafted from light organic cotton, this piece makes a go-to summery set with matching shorts.
